# Ty's personal [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap

Mac apps and packages I use that aren't important enough for any official Homebrew taps.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install tymick/personal-tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap tymick/personal-tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
